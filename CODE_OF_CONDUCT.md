# Participation Guidelines

This project respects Mozilla's [community participation guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/). These guidelines cover our behaviour as participants, facilitators, space wranglers, staff, volunteers, vendors, and anyone else involved in making this possible.

## How to treat each other

* Be respectful and welcoming
* Try to understand different perspectives
* Do not threaten violence
* Empower others
* Strive for excellence
* Don’t expect to agree with every decision

## Inclusion and Diversity

This project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. It doesn’t matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you.

We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community, including, but not limited to people of varied age, culture, ethnicity, gender, gender-identity, language, race, sexual orientation, geographical location and religious views.

Open Omaha-based activities should be inclusive and should support such diversity.

## Working in the Open

Because working open is one of our core values, Open Omaha program planning is done in the open on Github (check out our repo [here](https://github.com/open-omaha/project-ideas)). We hope participants will benefit from this culture of transparency and collaboration, and will continue to work with an open ethos in their projects after their time with Open Omaha.
