## About the Open Omaha Team

Open Omaha is committed to using civic tech to improve quality of life. We seek to help citizen, government, and nonprofit stakeholders solve problems.

Open Omaha is an open source organization. We make our projects freely and openly available. GitHub is where we collaborate, using *[Issues](https://github.com/open-omaha/project-ideas/issues)* where we break down projects into managable problems.

We hope you'll find what you're looking for, but if you need help feel free to get in touch with us! 

Take note of our [Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/).

## How To Propose or Discuss Project Ideas

[GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) work just like any other commenting system on the Internet. 

**First, you'll need to [create an account](https://github.com/join)**.

Then you have two options: 

- Comment on an existing idea (a.k.a. "issue")

Check out the [issues list](https://github.com/open-omaha/project-ideas/issues) to see if anyone's thinking the same way. If you see an idea that intersts you, click on it, read the discussion, and add your thoughts. You can look for the **Needs Leadership** label to find projects currently in need of someone to take charge!

- Create a new idea

If you don't see an idea listed, [add a new one](https://github.com/open-omaha/project-ideas/issues/new). You'll need to a title and description. Someone from the Open Omaha Core Team will follow up with you, likely with questions or feedback, and assign you to the issue to indicate you are leading the effort. 

## Next Steps

- Make a status update to your issues at least once a month to keep everyone informed. If we don't hear from you after some time, we'll assume you've moved on and ask others to take the lead.
- If nobody's talking yet, it might mean your idea needs more explanation. 
- If you're willing to be the champion of a project, you should let one of the [project leads](mailto:) know. Github is the platform we're using to collect and vet ideas and convert them into [active projects](https://github.com/open-omaha/project-ideas/). Once a project becomes active, we'll help you set up a repository on the Open Omaha Github organization so you can begin collaborating. We'll continue using the Issues feature on your own project repo to flag obstacles, opportunities, and answer questions. We will also add the project repo link to your idea issue and close it, indicating your graduation from idea to active project.
